I built the app after my mates and I settled on the final design and with the intent of using it myself. I have two properties, one in my home country and another in a foreign country. Before I settle the cash flow and legal matters associated with my houses, I'm going to change the apps architecture with scalability in mind. Specifically...

                                        <p id="vivid">What else can I say about EDM music besides that I like everything about it! The culture, the vibes, the expression. The sound of the bass and instruments and tuned wub wubs and thonks and electronic beats and voices, sometimes you'd think it was a fast pace jazz tune if Frankie Knuckles tells you to "Move your body". How do you get tired of something you've grown up with? Impossible!</p><p>I have this vision where two amazing things happen. First I long for music discovery that I just know I'll like when I find it. Spotify has its algorithms that recommend me playlists of music. Apple Music claims to have human curators which I like sometimes. Soundcloud does an excellent job of bubbling the top rated songs to the top of my searches.</p><p>There's somthing about technology that hasn't exploited the space between seeking and finding music in the real world. Facebook, texts, friends, and emails are all avenues of up and coming artists for me to be notified about and explore. I wouldn't have known of the vast genre that is hard tecno if it weren't for the people that have influenced me with that sound. I discovered Lane 8, Malaa, BRO HUG through a friend who sold me her ticket to Sam Pagannini. I discovered Shiba San and Laidback Luke among countless of other artists through texts and emails of their up and coming shows and a search of their works through Soundcloud.</p><h2>All this music, all these artists would have eventually found their way into my life, but this is just how some of it specifically came to be, how did you discover your most recent favorite aritst?</h2><p>Now here's why I think <b>Vivid Fliers</b> adds to the mix. I want a music player attached to each artists name to streamline the process of discovering their works. When EDC, Spring Awakening, Defqon.1, Freaky Deaky, Rapture you name it rave announces their lineup, I want to be up to date with all the artists to know if I fancy them or not. It can very well be the deciding factor when comparing a rave to a rave or an artist to another artist while at the rave. Vivid Fliers is actually an interface that overlaps designed fliers that's announcing a music venue. It's meant to produce a music store experience when you're faced with a lineup of dozens of artists you may not heard before or want to catch up on or want to get hyped on. <i>In the beginning this will be a web application technology perhaps a native program on the phone, in the future it will be physical fliers with electronics that play the music outright through some medium available to the holder of said flyers</i></P>

                                        <p id="route"><b>Spider router</b> is my crown jewel of a portfolio piece that demonstrates my skill and knowledge as well as my creativity.</p><p>I use many apps as tools during my driving time as a ride share partner with Uber and Lyft! I use radar to detect and track a storm as it passes. I use airport apps suggesting the time of arrival for airplanes. I use Google for traffic and available 24 hour facilities for snacks and breaks. I use SMS to track highway lane blocks. I use a timer to keep track of seconds in the background. I use the passenger apps to check how many competitors are around town. I use a lot of other apps too!</p><p>The idea behind this routing tool originated from a desire to keep all these features under one map suite, leveraging all the resources available across all these apps. The greatest driving force behind this was the challenge of illustrating these resources differently and in the most intuitive fashion that I could create. Specifically with the SMS client that gives the roadblocks as a resource, there is no such app on itunes or google play which illustrates this resource in a vivid manner as Spider Router does and with extreme precision perhaps minutes after they happen due to accidents for example. Waze' user sourced data allows it to report accidents and roadblocks on all roads but Spider Router taps into an actual system that's in place in my home city specifically for highways only.</p>
